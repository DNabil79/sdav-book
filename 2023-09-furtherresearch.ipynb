    "# 09 FURTHER RESEARCH DIRECTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "We have covered a lot of ground through this course, from the initial ideas around cyber security analytics, through to managing workflows, machine learning and visualisation, and different applications of analysis that may be required. Of course, future research will continue to evolve and we will see greater uses of data analytics to understand the world around us and how best to secure this.\n",

    "## Visualisation for Cyber Security\n",
    "\n",
    "The IEEE VizSec conference started in 2004 as the Workshop on Visualization and Data Mining for Computer Security, as a co-located event as part of the IEEE Vis conference – one of the largest International conferences on the topic of data visualisation. The conference is still an integral part of IEEE Vis, and continues to attract high-quality research publications. You can find more details about VizSec at https://vizsec.org/. There is also an online proceedings browser available at https://vizsec.dbvis.de/.\n",

    "# Future of Data Analytics in Cyber Security\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are just a small sample of articles and further reading that relate to the use of Machine Learning and Data Analytics for Cyber Security, ranging from Connected Autonomous Vechicles, HealthTech, and Industrial IoT - 3 key areas that are seeing significant impact from ML and data analytics, and that will plan an important role within society in our future.\n",
